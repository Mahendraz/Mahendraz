Mahendra Zulqarnaen
Smart Contract Engineer
I have successfully developed and implemented a scalable and decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) on the Polygon/Matic blockchain. The DAO integrates ERC-721 and ERC-20 standards to ensure smooth integration. Throughout this process, I have gained extensive knowledge in areas such as ERC-20, ERC-721 (NFT), ERC-1155 (Multi Token), and the DeFi-Uniswap protocol. To accomplish this, I deployed the project on the testnet using Hardhat and Pinata (Metadata IPFS), while also ensuring its adaptability for future frameworks. My expertise in Solidity and JavaScript as a smart contract engineer played a critical role in programming blockchain smart contracts, particularly in the field of Blockchain Development and Architecture. 
Overall, this endeavor has provided me with valuable insights into the practical implementation of decentralized systems, smart contract engineering, and the utilization of various blockchain standards.
